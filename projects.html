    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>For this final project, I thought of something close to my heart and decided to use the skills I learnt to create a small ring box. My initial idea was to have a ring box that has mood lighting installed within it, with a rotating ring holder and have ambient music play when its open. I decided to call the project: "My Damn Extra Ring Box"</p>

    <h2>Concept sketch</h2>
    <p>It being a ring box, I wanted it to be small enough to represent those youâ€™d use to propose, which is inCREDIBLY difficult considering I had to fit an entire circuit in. Thus, my initial sketch was 7x6x7cm, with a lid on the top.</p>
    <img src="final proj/website media/concept sketch.jpg" width="500px" height="300px"/>
    <p> There would be a separation in the middle to hide the circuit at the bottom half of the box.</p>

    <p> A bill of sale was also created to have a sense of how much this project would cost.</p>

    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
    <p>With the use of a pencil, ruler, cardboard and hot glue, I created my prototype of my desired product. The scale of the model is 7cm x 7cm x 7cm, which is the intial dimensions of the concept sketch.
    Here's what the prototype looks like:</p>

    <img src="final proj/website media/prototype 3.jpg" width="500px" height="300px"/>

    <h2>Lazer Cutting Component - Box Design</h2>
    <p> I adopted a similar design to my music box because I liked the concept and functionality of the box, while allowing an accesible space to access the circuit in the box.
    Here are the different Fusion360 sketches of the required pieces</p>

    <p> Similar to the music box, a set of parameters were used:</p>

    <h3>Lid</h3>

    <h3>Drawer</h3>

    <p> The required pieces were adapted onto CorelDraw and lazercut with the use of an Epilog Fusion M2 Lazer Cutter, and luckily this time, I had my measurements right and only required gluing.
      My final model for the ring box looks like this:</p>

    <h2>Arduino Circuit Component</h2>
    <p> This component was the worst to work on. It seriously took the longest time to work on - as of writing this, I am STILL working on the circuit, and I have spent at least 9 DAYS in a span of 4 WEEKS just figuring this part of the project out. I hardly understand circuits in its hardware form, much less the software coding.

    With the help of various classmates and lecturers and online resources, I managed to figure out a little something on Tinkercad. In my circuit, an LDR will serve as an <b>input</b> to command the Neopixel LED strip to on and the DC motor to rotate; my <b>outputs</b>. Since I was utilising an online library for my rainbow LEDs from an external source, I could not include that library simulation. Instead, I opted to programme the LDR and DC motor on tinkercad, then use the C++ code from there to implement into my actual circuit. Here is the online circuit and C++code.</p>

    <img src="final proj/website media/tinkercad circuit code.png" width="500px" height="300px"/>

    <p>Afterwards, with the use of an online Rainbow Neopixel LED library, I combined the code from the library with the code on tinkercad to programme my entire circuit.
    Attached is the circuit in real life, with the C++ code used:</p>
