    <h1>Final Project</h1>
    <h2>Ideation:</h2>
    <p>For this final project, I thought of something close to my heart and decided to use the skills I learnt to create a small ring box. My initial idea was to have a ring box that has mood lighting installed within it, with a rotating ring holder and have ambient music play when its open.</p>

    <h2>Concept sketch:</h2>
    <p>It being a ring box, I wanted it to be small enough to represent those youâ€™d use to propose, which is inCREDIBLY difficult considering I had to fit an entire circuit in. Thus, my initial sketch was 7x6x7cm, with a lid on the top.</p>
    <img src="final proj/website media/concept sketch.jpg" width="500px" height="300px"/>
    <p> There would be a separation in the middle to hide the circuit at the bottom half of the box.</p>

    <p> A bill of sale was also created to have a sense of how much this project would cost.</p>
