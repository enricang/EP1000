    <h1>Weekly Journal</h1>
    <h3>25 April 2022 - Website Development</h3>
    <p>During this week, I learnt to create the skeleton of a webpage with the use of HTML and CSS code, I learnt how to create titles, headings, paragraphs and tables, and also learnt how to embed an image (it’s more complicated than I thought). This involved a lot of googling and the use of W3 schools, which is the go-to website for learning HTML and CSS recommended by Mr Rodney himself.</p>

    <p>Here’s a small part of the code I used to create this webpage:</p>
    <img src="final proj/website media/html code example.png" width="500px" height="300px"/>

    <p>Afterwards, I learnt how to create a repository on Github and upload my webpages, before publishing it to make it a legitimate website under Github (it took me a while to do that as I was lost finding the different controls). </p>
    <p>Now, my website is live! It is now accessible at the website you are currently looking at.</p>

    <p> Although Mr Rodney recommended a CSS format from Jake Wright’s example, I personally didn’t take a liking to it and decided to design my own visual of the website I wanted.</p>

    <h3>2 May 2022 - Computer Graphics</h3>
    <p>This week, I learnt the difference between Raster and Vector graphics, and with the use of Inkscape, I managed to crop out specific parts of an image me and my fellow classmate, Damien took using vectors and merging them into a new background.</p>

    <h3>9 May 2022 to 11 Aug 2022 - Fusion 360</h3>
    <p>The first week was a rough one, we started using Fusion360 today and I had absolutely no prior experience using it. Fortunately, my skills of literally copying every single step my lecturer took was sufficient enough for me to create multiple objects in Fusion360. Definitely cool to see what Fusion360 is capable of.</p>

    <p>In a span of weeks, We were tasked to create multiple models,  including a wrench, some clock shaped thing, a lego brick, a mug, a hex nut, keychains, and a chess piece.</p>
    <p>Each project started with a sketch with dimensions laid out for us, which I adapted into Fusion360 and with the use of various tools such as revovle, rectangular pattern, combine, cut etc, I managed to develop these few items.</p>
    <p>I would write more, but I'd rather let the work show for itself, so here are the embedded files of each item made</p>

    <h4>Wrench</h4>

    <h4>Clock Shaped Thing</h4>
    <p> I named it amogus because I honestly have no idea what this is supposed to be and it looks like amogus so....</p>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43654915a991b04304?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h4>Lego Brick</h4>
    <p> This one was cool, I followed a YouTube tutorial for this and felt like I had been envisioned or something</p>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43591cfed8f9ea1039?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h4>Mug</h4>
    <p> For this, I learnt the revolve function. Man, it was eye opening.</p>

    <h4>Hex Nut</h4>

    <h4>Keychains</h4>
    <p> I created 2: One with the FabLab logo with a font as close as I could find, and one just for moi</p>

    <h5> Fablab Keychain</h5>

    <h4>Chess Piece</h4>
    <p> For this, I chose to make a queen piece as that's my favourite chess piece.</p>
