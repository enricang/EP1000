    <h1>Weekly Journal</h1>
    <h3>25 April 2022 - Website Development</h3>
    <p>During this week, I learnt to create the skeleton of a webpage with the use of HTML and CSS code, I learnt how to create titles, headings, paragraphs and tables, and also learnt how to embed an image (it’s more complicated than I thought). This involved a lot of googling and the use of W3 schools, which is the go-to website for learning HTML and CSS recommended by Mr Rodney himself.</p>

    <p>Here’s a small part of the code I used to create this webpage:</p>
    <img src="final proj/website media/html code example.png" width="500px" height="300px"/>

    <p>Afterwards, I learnt how to create a repository on Github and upload my webpages, before publishing it to make it a legitimate website under Github (it took me a while to do that as I was lost finding the different controls). </p>
    <p>Now, my website is live! It is now accessible at the website you are currently looking at.</p>
    <img src="final proj/website media/github page link.png" width="500px" height="150px"/>
    <p> Although Mr Rodney recommended a CSS format from Jake Wright’s example, I personally didn’t take a liking to it and decided to design my own visual of the website I wanted.</p>

    <h3>2 May 2022 - Computer Graphics</h3>
    <p>This week, I learnt the difference between Raster and Vector graphics, and with the use of Inkscape, I managed to crop out specific parts of an image me and my fellow classmate, Damien took using vectors and merging them into a new background.</p>

    <h3>9 May 2022 to 16 May 2022 - Fusion 360</h3>
    <p>The first week was a rough one, we started using Fusion360 and I had absolutely no prior experience using it. Fortunately, my skills of literally copying every single step my lecturer took was sufficient enough for me to create multiple objects in Fusion360. Definitely cool to see what Fusion360 is capable of.</p>

    <p>In a span of a few weeks, We were tasked to create multiple models,  including a wrench, some clock shaped thing, a lego brick, a mug, a hex nut, keychains, and a chess piece.</p>
    <p>Each project started with a sketch with dimensions laid out for us, which I adapted into Fusion360 and with the use of various tools such as revovle, rectangular pattern, combine, cut etc, I managed to develop these few items.</p>
    <p>I would write more, but I'd rather let the work show for itself, so here are the embedded files of each item made</p>

    <h4>Wrench</h4>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e439dc3449f13cf801d?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h4>Clock Shaped Thing</h4>
    <p> I named it amogus because I honestly have no idea what this is supposed to be and it looks like amogus so....</p>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43654915a991b04304?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h4>Lego Brick</h4>
    <p> This one was cool, I followed a YouTube tutorial for this and felt like I had been envisioned or something</p>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43591cfed8f9ea1039?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h4>Mug</h4>
    <p> For this, I learnt the revolve function. Man, it was eye opening.</p>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43f6e59bccc96646ef?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h4>Hex Nut</h4>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e434d57feaed12812cb?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h4>Keychains</h4>
    <p> I created 2: One with the FabLab logo with a font as close as I could find, and one just for moi.</p>

    <h5> Fablab Keychain</h5>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e4318cc56952c7e383a?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h5> Personal Keychain</h5>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43296574d6b3ef583c?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h3>23 May 2022 to 27 June 2022 - Individual Assignments; Fusion360</h3>

    <h4>Music Box</h4>
    <p> For the music box, I wanted to create something sleek yet functional. I was thinking on how to integrate a wind up musical mechanism, and decided on a 2 tier drawer with lid system.
    Here is my concept sketch:</p>
      <img src="blog pictures/music box concept sketch.jpg" width="500px" height="450px"/>

    <p> Here are the Fusion360 models of the specific parts:</p>
    <h5>Body</h5>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43992af8d8b9816d21?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p> These are the parameters I used for the body of the music box. The drawer and lid were created by accounting for the measurements of the body itself.</p>
    <img src="blog pictures/music box parameters.png" width="700px" height="200px"/>

    <h5>Lid</h5>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e4351d9c13a7407faf6?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h5>Drawer</h5>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e432c433038dafc6b2a?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p> The required pieces were adapted onto CorelDraw and lazercut with the use of an Epilog Fusion M2 Lazer Cutter, and after many hours of sanding (I apparently messed up the dimensions for the drawer) and gluing, my model for the music box looks like this:</p>
    <img src="blog pictures/music box 1.jpg" width="500px" height="500px"/>
    <img src="blog pictures/music box 2.jpg" width="500px" height="500px"/>

    <h4>Chess Piece</h4>
    <p> For this, I chose to make a queen piece as that's my favourite chess piece.
      I used a 2d reference picture of a queen piece online to sketch on Fusion360, before using the revolve function to create my model.
      Here is the reference picture used:</p>
      <img src="blog pictures/queen.png" width="300px" height="300px"/>

    <p> Here is the Fusion360 file of the model I created.</p>
    <iframe src="https://ichat2223.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e4349b673df5a223667?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>


    <p> Afterwards, I used cura to view and slice the model, making sure to use some suggested parameters from the 3d printing course on the FabLab module.
      The 3d printed model looks like this:</p>
      <img src="blog pictures/chess.jpg" width="500px" height="550px"/>

  <h3>27 June 2022 to 18 July 2022 - Arduino Circuits</h3>
  <p> Basically within the span of these few weeks, I didn't really understand much but I learnt about input and output devices, the basics of the C++ language, and managed to replicate some guided circuits created by my lecturers.
  Here are some examples of the circuits + thir C++ code.</p>

  <h4> 7 Segment Display</h4>
