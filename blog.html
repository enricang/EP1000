    <h1>Weekly Journal</h1>
    <h3>25 April 2022 - Website Development</h3>
    <p>During this week, I learnt to create the skeleton of a webpage with the use of HTML and CSS code, I learnt how to create titles, headings, paragraphs and tables, and also learnt how to embed an image (it’s more complicated than I thought). This involved a lot of googling and the use of W3 schools, which is the go-to website for learning HTML and CSS recommended by Mr Rodney himself.</p>

    <p>Here’s a small part of the code I used to create this webpage:</p>
    <img src="final proj/website media/html code example.png" width="500px" height="300px"/>

    <p>Afterwards, I learnt how to create a repository on Github and upl3 oad my webpages, before publishing it to make it a legitimate website under Github (it took me a while to do that as I was lost finding the different controls). </p>
    <p>Now, my website is live! It is now accessible at the website you are currently looking at.</p>
    <img src="final proj/website media/github page link.png" width="500px" height="150px"/>
    <p> Although Mr Rodney recommended a CSS format from Jake Wright’s example, I personally didn’t take a liking to it and decided to design my own visual of the website I wanted.</p>
